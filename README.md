# WeatherWear: Intelligent Weather-Based Clothing Recommendation System

WeatherWear is a Python-based intelligent clothing recommendation tool that helps users decide what to wear based on real-time weather conditions.  
By integrating with the **Open-Meteo API**, the system retrieves live meteorological data, analyzes temperature, wind, precipitation, and humidity, and generates context-aware clothing recommendations for **indoor or outdoor** activities.

The project also visualizes a **5-day temperature forecast** using Matplotlib, making weather trends easy to understand.
